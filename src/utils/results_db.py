"""One results database for every experiment: output/raw_all.csv.

Every experiment calls `record()` when it finishes, so a later summary never
has to hunt through output/<experiment>/ for the right per_unit file, guess a
setting from a filename, or re-derive which of two files is canonical.

One row = one evaluation unit under one setting:

    setting   backbone, head, variant, stage1, n_train
    unit      mediator, fold, domain, user_id, seed
    result    srocc, plcc, ccc, eff_dof
    provenance  recorded_at (date the run produced it), experiment

*** duplicate policy ***
Re-running the same setting should give the same numbers, so re-recording it
is normally a no-op. `record()` therefore compares the incoming rows to what
is already stored, on the full key, rounded to 4 decimal places:

  identical  -> the stored row is kept and the new one dropped, so the DB does
                not grow every time an experiment is re-run.
  different  -> BOTH rows are kept, each with its own recorded_at.

The second case is not supposed to happen. Keeping both (rather than
overwriting) is the point: it preserves the evidence that the same setting
produced two answers, so the cause can be found instead of silently losing
one of them. `conflicts()` lists them.
